## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-04

### Added

- `TcpTransportBuilder` with configurable allocation limit for DoS protection
- Automatic key extension for AES-192/256 and 3DES privacy protocols

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Redesigned error types around caller actions and boxed `Error` for smaller `Result`s
- **Breaking:** `TrapV1Pdu::v2_trap_oid()` now returns `Result` to handle invalid trap values
- Use explicit tracing targets with brace syntax for stable log filtering
- Reduced BER `MAX_LENGTH` from 16MB to 2MB
- Use `getrandom` for salt initialization and skip zero on wraparound
- Compute `VarBind::encoded_size()` arithmetically instead of allocating

### Fixed

- `Pdu::decode` rejecting valid GETBULK requests
- OID first subidentifier overflow during BER encoding
- Enforce `MAX_OID_LEN` during BER decode per RFC 2578 Section 3.5
- PDU `error_index` and GETBULK parameter validation during decode
- Integer overflow in BER decoder bounds checks
- USM `engine_boots`/`engine_time` validation per RFC 3414
- Cap `estimated_time()` at `MAX_ENGINE_TIME` per RFC 3414 Section 2.2.1
- Broken doc links

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added

- Agent concurrent request processing with semaphore-based limiting and graceful shutdown via `CancellationToken`
- `View::check_subtree()` for 3-state access detection (included/excluded/ambiguous)
- Blumenthal key extension (`KeyExtension::Blumenthal`) for AES-192/256 interoperability with net-snmp
- `Transport::max_message_size()` for transport-aware msgMaxSize capping
- IP_PKTINFO support via `quinn-udp` for correct source IP on multi-homed agents

### Changed

- VACM access selection implements full RFC 3415 preference order (securityModel, contextMatch, contextPrefix length, securityLevel)
- SNMPv3 generates fresh msgID on each retry attempt per RFC 3412 Section 6.2
- Request IDs masked to 31 bits for RFC 1157/3412 compliance
- Agent-reported msgMaxSize capped to transport limit

### Fixed

- msgID and msgMaxSize bounds validation per RFC 3412 HeaderData definition

### Removed

- Unused dependencies and dead code

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-01

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Unified `UdpTransport` and `SharedUdpTransport` into a single
  `UdpTransport` with `UdpHandle` pattern. The new design uses a background
  receiver task with sharded pending maps for correct concurrent request handling.
- **Breaking:** `Transport` trait changes:
  - Renamed `target()` to `peer_addr()` for consistency with std
  - Added `register_request(request_id, timeout)` for pre-send slot registration
  - `recv()` no longer takes a timeout parameter (uses registered deadline)
- Request IDs are now allocated from a global counter for process-wide uniqueness,
  preventing collisions when multiple transports exist

### Added

- Configurable retry strategies with backoff support:
  - `RetryStrategy::Fixed` - constant delay between retries (default)
  - `RetryStrategy::Exponential` - exponential backoff with configurable base and max
  - `RetryStrategy::None` - disable retries entirely
- `UdpTransport::shutdown()` for graceful termination of background receiver
- `ClientBuilder::build_with(&UdpTransport)` for convenient shared transport usage

### Fixed

- Concurrent UDP requests no longer cause false timeouts due to race conditions
  in response routing
- Memory leak from orphaned pending responses now prevented via periodic cleanup

### Removed

- `SharedUdpTransport` and `SharedUdpHandle` (functionality merged into `UdpTransport`)

## [0.1.2] - 2026-01-01

### Fixed

- `MasterKeys` can now be used without also specifying passwords. Previously,
  using `Auth::usm().with_master_keys()` would fail validation requiring
  `auth_password` even though keys were already derived.

### Documentation

- Significantly expanded rustdoc coverage across all modules with examples
- Added crate-level documentation sections for error handling, tracing,
  agent compatibility, and scalable SNMPv3 polling
- Improved examples to use test container credentials and RFC 5737 TEST-NET
  addresses

## [0.1.1] - 2025-12-31

### Added

- SNMPv1, v2c, and v3 client support
- GET, GETNEXT, GETBULK, SET operations
- WALK and BULKWALK streaming iterators
- SNMPv3 USM security:
  - Authentication: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512
  - Privacy: DES, AES-128, AES-192, AES-256
- Transport implementations:
  - `UdpTransport` for single-target clients
  - `TcpTransport` for stream-based connections
  - `SharedUdpTransport` for scalable polling (many targets, single FD)
- `NotificationReceiver` for trap/inform handling
- `Agent` with `MibHandler` trait for building SNMP agents
- VACM (View-Based Access Control Model) support
- Two-phase SET commit per RFC 3416
- `oid!` macro for compile-time OID parsing
- Zero-copy BER encoding/decoding
- CLI utilities: `asnmp-get`, `asnmp-walk`, `asnmp-set`
